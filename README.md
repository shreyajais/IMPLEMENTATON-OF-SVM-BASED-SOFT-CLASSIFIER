# IMPLEMENTATON-OF-SVM-BASED-SOFT-CLASSIFIER
Types of  Classification SVM Algorithms: Hard Margin: To find best hyperplane without tolerating any form of misclassification Soft Margin: We add a degree 0f tolerance in SVM. In this way we allow the model to voluntary misclassify few data points if that can lead to identifying a hyperplane able to generalise better to unseen data. IMPLEMENTATION  Soft Margin SVM can be implemented in Scikit-Learn by adding a C penalty term in svm.SVC. The bigger C &amp; the more penalty the algorithm gets when making a misclassification
